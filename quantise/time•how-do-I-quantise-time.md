title: How do I quantise time?
---

The purpose of quantisation is twofold:
- reduce complexity down to accomodate Miller's Law: that average human working memory is 7Â±2
- align with natural cycles were possible

# 19 years: the metonic cycle

In terms of human lifetimes, the metonic cycle is a natural astronomical cycle that meets the above goals. A human lifetime would be 4 to 6 of these units.

The cycle marks alignment with the moon and sun. Choosing any arbitrary lunar phase with any equinox or solistice will produce any of a number of possible arbitrary dates for transitioning between these units. My current preference is to align the first quarter phase with the september equinox, which produces a cycle that reoccurs on about the 23rd of September 1974, 1993, 2012, 2031, etc.
